# AbraTools Alpha
### IMPORTANT: **Code is a mess. Be careful using it in production. Bug reports, feature requests and PRs are appreciated.**

AbraTools is an **unfinished animation toolset** for Blender 3. It utilizes the Preferences header so you're able to move the panel where you desire. It comes with some basic tools to help make certian animation tasks a bit less tedious:

* **Download** AbraTools [here](https://github.com/abrasic/abratools/releases). 
* **Installation instructions** [here](https://docs.abx.gg/support/download-and-setup). 
* **Read the docs** [here](https://docs.abx.gg).

# SETUP

The best way to use the Toolshelf is by dragging out a new area (by clicking and dragging up on a corner of an existing area) and switch it to the Preferences window. From there, click on the 'aT' icon at the right side of the header and it's ready to go!

You can shrink the panel so only the buttons in the header are shown (as shown in the gif above). If you ever want to make changes to your toolshelf, you can do so by expanding it again and you can access the Toolshelf settings.
