# AbraTools Alpha
### IMPORTANT: **Code is a mess. Be careful using it in production. Bug reports, feature requests and PRs are appreciated.**

* **Download** AbraTools [here](https://github.com/abrasic/abratools/releases/download/alpha1/abraTools_a1.zip). 
* **Installation instructions** [here](https://docs.abx.gg/support/download-and-setup). **Read the docs** [here](https://docs.abx.gg). As of alpha 2 (ui rewrite), docs are kinda out of date, but the functionality persists regardless.


AbraTools is an **unfinished animation toolset** for Blender 3. Originally I wanted to keep it for myself but I decided to make a public version for anyone out there that may find this interesting.

It provides simple operators in a custom header with things like *quick-view F-Curves*, *easily create motion paths*, and other ways to *manipulate keys*. More other cool things to come.

i suck at git btw, bear with me
