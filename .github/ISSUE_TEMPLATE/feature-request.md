<!--
            ASK YOURSELF THIS BEFORE SUBMITTING A FEATURE REQUEST:

    - Does your feature ALREADY EXIST ELSEWHERE?
         abraTools is not a competitor to other animation tools; if an add-on or tool already exists for the feature you want, we more than likely won't accept your request.

    - Is your feature SIMPLE?
         Our tools aim to be relatively simple to add by design, so your feature request should mostly reflect that. If your request sounds too far-fetched or too complex to be implemented, it probably is.

    - Is your feature RELVEANT?
         As of now, we are a toolset that focuses on the animation workflow. We are currently not accepting feature requests that implement utilities for 3D space beyond the scope of animation. 

    - Is your feature USEFUL TO OTHERS?
         Is the feature you're requesting in demand? Do you believe the feature would be useful to other animators, not just you?
