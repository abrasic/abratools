<!--
            PLEASE READ ME BEFORE YOU SUBMIT YOUR BUG REPORT!

    - Blender versions 2.93 and older are NOT SUPPORTED and will NOT BE GIVEN SUPPORT.

    - If you're reporting a bug from a pre-release/latest version, check to make sure that you actually have the latest build, as those builds can be updated often. Re-download the add-on if you need to: github.com/abrasic/abratools/releases/tag/latest

    - Please fill out this form as descriptive and concise as you possibly can. Providing descriptive details such as reproduction steps and screenshots are EXTREMELY HELPFUL to us and very appreciated.

    - The 'abraTools version' is NOT 1.0.0! It is shown in the "Warning" column of the add-on in the Blender Preferences (ex. 'beta1', 'beta2', etc).
